# HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)
- Terraform is written in _HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)_ and is designed to be both human and machine-readable.
- HCL is built using **code configuration blocks**. Terraform Code Configuration block types include:
  - Terraform `Settings` Block
  - Terraform `Provider` Block
  - Terraform `Resource` Block
  - Terraform `Data` Block
  - Terraform `Input Variables` Block
  - Terraform `Local Variables` Block
  - Terraform `Output Values` Block
  - Terraform `Modules` Block
- The _low-level syntax_ of the Terraform language is defined in terms of a syntax called _HCL_.
